        Parent-Teacher Conferences
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are two scheduled Parent-Teacher Conferences: Fall and Spring. 
      </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>fall</strong> conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. Teachers
          meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions they 
          may have regarding their child's learning experiences
      </p>
  
      <p>
          The <strong>spring</strong> conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. Teachers fill out an 
          assessment form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a 
          well-rounded picture of each child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that 
          parents have time to read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers take note of students' activities in order to learn about each child, 
        plan for individual and group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. 
        A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time by request of parents and/or teachers. 
      </p>
      
        
      <h3>
        Assessment
      </h3>
      <p>
        Teachers keep notes on each child based on interactions and observations both in the classroom
        and during their play. Assessments include checklists, timelines, and examples of the childrenâ€™s writings and pictures 
        to illustrate their strengths and weaknesses in all areas of development.
