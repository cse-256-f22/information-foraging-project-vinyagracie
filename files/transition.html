      <h1>Supporting Students' Transitions</h1>

      <h2>
        The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. 
        Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to meet students’ needs.
      </h2>

      <p>
        If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
            Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase 
            student confidence
        </li>
        <li>
            Offering more opportunities for exploration
        </li>
        <li>
            Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
        </li>
        <li>
            Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration
        </li>
        <li>
            Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage 
            different parts of the brain in the learning process
        </li>
        <li>
            Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, 
            skill, or area of concern
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Communication and assessment is ongoing throughout the year. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to 
        discuss your child's adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. 
        Additionally, <a href = "files/communication.html">Parent-Teacher Conferences</a> happen twice a year. 
        If you feel the need to speak to a teacher or a director, please email or call the office. Teachers can 
        be reached by phone or email after the school day is over. 
      </p>
