      <h3>
        Assessment
      </h3>
      <p>
        Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, 
        conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers
        keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. 
        Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the childrenâ€™s writings and pictures. 
        Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for 
        children.

      <h3>
        Parent-Teacher Conferences
      </h3>
      <p>
        The school has two scheduled Parent Conferences during the school year. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled 
        at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers. Teachers take note of students' activities
        throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and group needs, and communicate with parents
        on an ongoing basis. 
        </p>
    
    <p>
        The <strong>fall</strong> conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. Teachers
        meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions they 
        may have regarding their child's learning experiences
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>spring</strong> conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. Teachers fill out an 
        assessment form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a 
        well-rounded picture of each child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that 
        parents have time to read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
